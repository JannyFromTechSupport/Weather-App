WEATHER APP

Janny's Weather App is a web application that displays current weather information for cities using the OpenWeather API. It features dynamic updates via AJAX, so the page doesnâ€™t reload when fetching data. The app includes a custom favicon and relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its implementation. To use, clone the repository, open WeatherApp.html in a web browser, and enter a city name to see the weather information. For more details, visit the OpenWeather API.
